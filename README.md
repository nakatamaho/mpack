# The MPLAPACK is a multiprecision linear algebra package based on BLAS and LAPACK.
This package is rewritten in C++, and supports several high precision
libraries like GMP, MPFR and QD etc so that users can choose for user's
convenience. The MPLAPACK is a free software (2-clause BSD style license with
original license by LAPACK).

# Supported platforms

* Ubuntu 20.04, 18.04 (amd64, AArch64)
* CentOS 7,8 (amd64, AArch64)
* Ubuntu 20.04 (amd64) + Intel oneAPI
* macOS (Intel) + macports (you may use homebrew instead, small modification of build script req'ed)
* Windows (64bit; mingw64 on Ubuntu with wine64)

# Supported multiple precision libraries and floating point formats

* MPFR + MPC https://www.mpfr.org/ and http://www.multiprecision.org/mpc/  (arbitrary precision with IEEE like rounding mode)
* GMP https://gmplib.org/ (arbitrary precision)
* double (binary64)
* DD, QD (https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbsoftware/) (DD=approx. binary128, QD=approx. binary256)
* _Float128 (binary128; via glibc or libquadmath; automatically detected)
* _Float64x (extended precision of double; binary80 Intel CPU only)

We use MPFR + MPC as the primary arithmetic class.

* 2012/06/16: MPACK 0.7.0! Announcement
* 2012/06/16: Development has been migrated to SVN repository.
* 2011/10/28: Rgemm accleration in double-double precision on NVIDIA C2050 GPU is now available. Even though papers are not published, you can just try by "make". Note that only CUDA 3.2 is supported. Origial release announce is here.
* 2011/08/24: Rgemm accleration on NVIDIA C2050 GPU is coming. Unforutnately paper are rejected, so please wait... Here is a pdf slide.
* 2010/08/20: MPACK 0.6.7! Includes condition number estimators; Rgecon and Rpocon. Now 100 MLAPACK routines, and license has been changed to 2-caluse BSD style license. No longer use LGPLv3.
* 2010/08/6: MPACK 0.6.6! Build fix release. Tested on various Linux distributions.
* 2010/05/31: A paper for MPACK (0.6.4) in Japanese has been uploaded.
* 2010/05/21: MPACK 0.6.5! MPFR support, and MBLAS license has been changed to BSD style. Still MLAPACK part is LGPLv3. I'll replace hopefully soon.
* 2010/01/13: MPACK 0.6.4! BUILD FIX RELEASE! PLEASE CHECK ON YOUR ENVIRONMET! THANKS! ALSO WINDOWS IS SUPPORTED!
* 2009/12/18: POSTER and SLIDE ARE UPLOADED; MPACK (MBLAS/MLAPACK) poster at HPCS2010 in English, and slide in Japanese, and I did two seminars about MPACK (MBLAS/MLAPACK) @NII and @Tokyo Univ; here is the slide.
* 2009/11/24: MPACK 0.6.0!

* 2009/9/17: GMP/QD/DD integration is going very well; now builds the mlapack part as well.
* 2009/9/11: Now CVS version of MBLAS supports QD and DD. I abandoned "explicit generation of instances" for bad performance.
* 2009/5/25: Now I switched to template programming so that the library will be most portable. We automatically generate GMP, QD and DD versions via "explicit generation of instances". For real calculations, source code level compatibility is retained and also we can made some optimized version as well, whereas complex code we need a small changes. Typically 2-3 percent performance loss have been observed.
